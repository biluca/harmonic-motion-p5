Combining 2 Circles with different Animation Speeds, we can observe the describing of a new pattern, drawing a whole different figure.

 - The new Figure consider the Y Coordinate from the Left Circle.

Dynamically generating Circles & Combinations we can observe the most interesting figures taking form:
